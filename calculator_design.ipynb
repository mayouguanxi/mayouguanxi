        "The second will implement the final design and, rather than have a separate file for each module, will combine related functions in one code cell. In addition to the practising sequence, selection, repetition, input, output, assignment and simple mathematical operations, you will get a chance to practice creating and calling functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third notebook will split each module into a file. This process will allow you to practise importing local modules into the main notebook. This method will present some challenges with Google Colab's limitation of editing one notebook per virtual machine instance.\n",

        "\n",
        "We all think differently, and our methodology is flexible enough to accommodate different approaches to getting a working program. Although I have suggested three designs, it is not as simple as this. Often we start with the initial basic design, then as we implement and test, it evolves into a solution with functions. Then after more thinking and understanding, we may group similar tasks into modules ending up with something very similar to the highly modular final design.\n",
        "\n",
        "So try not to think of the three upcoming notebooks as independent designs rather than iterations from a good design, to a better design, and to an even better design.
