        "4. Use the PyPI instead of doing it yourself (*search and import module*)\n",
        "5. Use the Right Data Types and Structures (*int, float, list, etc. *)\n",
        "6. Write Readable Code (*meaningful names and comments*)\n",
        "7. Create readable documentation (*Docstrings*)\n",
